### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a SAP Business Intelligence Senior Consultant with Windhoff Group. In this role, I focus on SAP BW/4HANA and ABAP as well as HANA development topics. I authored the ebook <a href="https://www.analysisoffice.net">SAP Analysis for Office - The Comprehensive Guide</a> and work on the Reporting Tool BOARD for automatic distribution of Analysis for Office reports.
